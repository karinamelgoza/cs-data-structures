class Stack():
    """LIFO stack.

    Implemented using a Python list; since stacks just need
    to pop and push, a list is a good implementation, as
    these are O(1) for native Python lists. However, in cases
    where performance really matters, it might be best to
    use a Python list directly, as it avoids the overhead
    of a custom class.

    Or, for even better performance (& typically smaller
    memory footprint), you can use the `collections.deque`
    object, which can act like a stack.

    (We could also write our own LinkedList class for a
    stack, where we push things onto the head and pop things
    off the head (effectively reversing it), but that would be less
    efficient than using a built-in Python list or a
    `collections.deque` object)
